## From 2018 Interview

First I had an intro call with the CTO. He was friendly and asked me questions about my recent work at my previous company. I also got to ask a ton about Nova's current stage and future opportunities which was helpful.
The first real interview was a technical experience deep dive as they call it, with a technical interview block right after it. The interviewing engineer asked me about my work in very high detail and asked my why I made certain decisions and asked me to explain the concepts that I used. The second interview (immediately after the first one) was a systems design question with some coding involved. It was an open ended question where I got to brainstorm with my interviewer, after which I had to pseudo-code a solution in a screen-share IDE. Both interviews were over video-chat and I had two different engineers interview me.
The next step was a final day on-site that last quite a few hours. It was fully packed with some more technical interviews, coffee chats with the business development team, and a casual lunch with a few people. It also included an interview with the CEO, as I guess at the current size of Nova it is really important for almost everyone to meet a candidate.
The last stage was about references and clearing any outstanding questions and an opportunity to gather more information (I scheduled a few extra coffee chats with some on the team I haven't met yet to get more info).
Overall a really good experience interviewing. They made it very personal and made sure I was always asked whether I have any other questions about the team, product or business.

### How would you design a photo-sharing application?
It was one of the system design questions that I got presented. It involved some brainstorming with the back-end engineer who interviewed me. Eventually, I got to a simple implementation with only a few routes with some authentication on top of it. He asked some extensions for the project and I decided to implement a duplicates-check system with hashes on the back-end. Once we had the blueprint for a solution he asked me to code up some routes and logic to store, retrieve and handle authentication for the app. Fundamentally the question was not hard if you've been around in software engineering for a while. However, there was limited time and I had to make trade-offs and do the right prioritization. I guess that's what he was looking for and I realized afterward that I went on some tangents that were a waste of time. Think I did well though and got a working solution up.

## From 2019 Interview

I enjoyed the interview. The team (I learned after the fact) takes care to design the interview process to be inclusive and reflective of the day-to-day, rather than focused on theoretical computer science textbook questions. It started with a take home assignment to build a class from scratch. During the day-long interview, I was (a) asked to present my implementation (b) do a second exercise related to their code base (c) whiteboard through a systems design problem.

### Design an app that efficiently stores website visitor traffic.
