- do something with subsets
- The first one was a LeetCode hard question and the second one is medium/hard.
- Graph and list problem. No behavioral. Technical questions directly.  
- Medium difficulty recursion problem  
- Conceptually (very) difficult quicksort-varient problem. You won't find something like this in Cracking the Coding Interview.  
- Two rounds were coding rounds, which involved writing the solution in an ide, compiling it and testing it against their test cases. The questions were pretty straight forward. There was a system design round and an experience round. The system design round was like any other system design round, but with less fluff about technologies to use and more about identifying bottlenecks and improving them and getting the data model right. I really enjoyed the system design round. The experience round was just me explaining one of my most recent projects.
- Given a list of strings find all the pairs, when concatenated, form palindrome.  
- Two coding questions - straight forward again. I appreciate that they don’t ask hard LeetCode questions that you would never use in real life. Instead they asked practical, thoughtful problems. One was a command line interface that did some simple calculations - it was more about how appropriately you can model and structure your code based on the requirements, and less about hammering out an algorithm. The second was collaboratively building a message dispatch system with some boilerplate code. This one was quite fun. Never once was I asked about Big O, which I appreciate.
Two core value interviews - very simple, just talk about yourself and what you like to do! It’s more for you to understand their company culture.
Architecture - build a blog system, pretty easy. Make sure to have deeper levels of understandings for deadlocks and mutexes. Had to dig deep into my experience at my first job for this one! I would do some heavy reading in processes and threads before coming in.
- Dynamic programming and graph-based questions.
