## 2018 Interview
Recruiter reached out to me first followed by a google hangout interview. They let you use whatever you are comfortable with: IDE/editor/terminal

### A math question that you first solve by hand i.e . calculations. Followed by coding the solution for a generic problem where the input and output is a JSON.
  
I think the key in generic questions like this is to be careful to cover the fundamentals, and to be familiar with all the followups so you're prepared for whatever they throw at you. Maybe do a mock interview with a Coinbase Senior Software Engineering expert on PrepTick to get a real-world answer? They give lots of guidance and pro tips on how to deal with this kind of stuff.

## 2019 Interview
Please role-play teaching me a new concept.

Question involving designing the architecture of a new  application, from designing data models and API endpoints to UI and component organization to deployment strategy, plus questions about scalability and performance.

Build a fairly simple, familiar game in the terminal (they  tell you which game), using the language of your choice. You have 90 minutes to complete it. This is mostly about seeing how you organize code, and name variables and stuff like that.
	
I was contacted by a recruiter via email. After a brief phone call (standard stuff), I did a more technical phone interview (what I've been doing recently, my strengths & weaknesses, etc.). After that, I was invited in for an on-site. It was a six-hour affair covering all the bases: Pair programming (two sessions), system design (one session), HR interview (people skills), manager interviews (what I've been doing, how Coinbase functions, etc.). The pair programming was standard "Cracking the Coding Interview" stuff seen all over Silicon Valley. The system design was tangentially related to Coinbase and was a bit more technical than I expected. (Hint: Make sure your DB schema writing chops are good.) Overall, the interviews were respectful. One interview did have a bit of a "Gotcha!" feel to it but that could just be me. If you go in prepared, you'll do fine.

A group of friends go on a trip. Some people pay some transactions in full, which should be divided equally to all. At the end, how to settle everyone's debt.  

Q: Keep track of the payments sent and owed between people and calculate how much each person owes another at the end.
